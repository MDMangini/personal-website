I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Southern California. I graduated from Harvard University with a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government in 2022. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University and a Postdoctoral Associate in Political Economy with the Leitner Program in Comparative and International Political Economy at Yale University. Before graduate school I worked in economic consulting and I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. My research primarily studies economic coercion and the international political economy of trade, but I also have interests in state formation and the politics of structural transformation.
