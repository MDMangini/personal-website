I graduated in 2022 from Harvard University with a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government. Beginning in September 2023 I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Leitner Program in Comparative and International Political Economy at Yale University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. Before graduate school I worked in economic consulting and I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. My research primarily studies the international political economy of trade, but I also have interests in state formation and the politics of structural transformation.
