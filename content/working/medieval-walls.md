abstract: "The rise of the modern European state coincided with the arrival of a new technology, artillery, that changed the balance of offensive vs. defensive capabilities. What role did this technological shift play in the development of centralized nation-states? We propose a theory of how the Gunpowder Revolution encouraged European cities to cede sovereignty to proto-states in exchange for security by significantly raising the construction costs of effective defensive fortifications. States could provide defenses more efficiently by coordinating resources, constructing defenses in strategic locations, and wielding authority to alleviate collective action problems. We test our theory empirically with data on the fortifications of over 4,000 European localities."
