# API101: Markets and Market Failure

I have had the great pleasure and privilege of helping teach the Harvard Kennedy School's [introductory microeconomics course](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/courses/resources-incentives-and-choices-i-markets-and-market-failures) for Masters of Public Policy students. While a few of our students in a typical semester have a substantial background in economics, most have only a little experience and some are encountering economics for the very first time.

I helped update the class for a fully virtual format during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of that project, I created a series of supplementary instructional videos called the **TF Video Series** to help students with some of the more challenging material. I am including the videos below as both a sample of my teaching style and as a resource for former students who may wish to review them. As always, please [contact me](mailto:mangini@g.harvard.edu) with any questions.
