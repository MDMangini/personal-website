I recently graduated from Harvard University with a Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government. Beginning in September 2022 I will be a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University. Before graduate school I worked in economic consulting and I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. My research primarily studies the international political economy of trade, but I also have interests in state formation and the politics of structural transformation.
